\section{Question 1}
The file \emph{image\_video.cpp} and \emph{video\_image.cpp}
contains the code to convert from former to latter. 

Experiments were done on \emph{sample-files/big\_buck\_bunny\_480p\_1mb.mp4} and the
outputs were stored in a folder.

For combining images, the output images from the previous executables
were used. The frame rate is supplied as an argument to the function,
and is customizable.

\section{Question 2}
The file \emph{camera\_capture\_gui.cpp} contains the code to capture
from a device and save the frames to a directory. The laptop camera
device, available at $0$ was used for this particular program. 

\section{Question 3}
Chroma Keying was done in the HSV color space. It was observed that
values very close to 60 were common in the green screen to be edited and
the threshold was manually set to match those parameters.

The code is in the file \emph{chroma\_keying.cpp}.

The required videos are in \emph{sample-files} again. The green\_cut.mp4 and boat.mp4 files were used this time.
